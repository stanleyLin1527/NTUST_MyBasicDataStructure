In Data Structure lessons, I leart about:  
  - stack & queue  
  - 4 kinds of linked-list (singly or doubly, circular or not)  
  - BST & its variant (AVL, Red-Black)  
  - multiway trees (B and B+)  
  
After finishing the lecture of Data Structure, I think I do know these basic Data structure,  
but I didn't do much practice about how to actually implement them during the semester.  
So, I started to implement some basic data structure in 2023 winter.

In this repo, I use template class to implement stack, queue, and linked-list in C++.  
I actually implement BST too, but given that the implementation of AVL tree and Red-Black tree haven't finished yet,  
I choose not to put them on to this repo.  
Due to the complexity of implementing multiway trees and the new semester is coming, they are postponed.  
I hope I can finish all Data Structures I have leart before I graduate from college.
